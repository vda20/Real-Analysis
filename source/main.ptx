      <title>Introduction</title>

      <section xml:id="section-title">
        <title>How is this course different from Calculus?</title>
        <p>A large portion of this course will consist in studying real numbers, functions of a real variable, 
        continuity, limits, derivatives and integrals. So what is the difference with the Calculus course?
        An example will be useful to explain the difference. Suppose Jasmine has just taken the Calculus course,
        and  she is helping Kevin with this problem: If <m>f(x)=x^{10}</m>, find <m>f'(x)</m>. Jasmine solves
         the problem and gets the right answer: using the power rule,
          she finds that <m>f'(x)=10x^9</m>. This is what she learned in the 
        Calculus course.</p>
        <p>
        But suppose now Kevin asks: "But what does <m>f'(x)</m> stand for?". 
        Jasmine will probably answer: "It's the derivative of <m>f(x)</m>". This is correct, but it really doesn't 
        explain what it is, it just says what its name is. If Kevin is curious he will want to know what 
        the derivative is
        all about and why we are so interested in it. Depending on how well Jasmine learned the Calculus material,
        she may be able to explain that the derivative is the limit as <m>h</m> goes to zero of the 
        difference quotient <m>(f(x+h)-f(x))/h</m>, and it represents the slope of the tangent line to the 
        graph of <m>f</m>. But if Kevin were to press her with the next natural question:
         "but what is a limit? And what is a tangent line?", she would not be able to give a precise answer. 
         And almost surely, 
         she will not be able to explain why the derivative of <m>x^n</m> is <m>nx^{n-1}</m>. Because in the 
         Calculus course much of the focus is on how to <alert>use</alert> some rules, without worrying where they 
         come from. 
          </p>
          <p>In Real Analysis, we will give a very precise meaning to all notions we meet. So it is not enough to say
          that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x)</m> is a number that <m>f(x)</m> gets closer and closer to when <m>x</m> gets 
          closer and closer to <m>c</m>. Instead, we will give a precise <term>definition</term> that uses only notions to 
          which we can already give a precise meaning. In the example of the limit, the notion of "closer and closer" 
          commonly used in the Calculus course is not clear at all. We may have an intuitive idea, but what precisely
          do we mean by "closer and closer"?
          </p>
          <p>
          The other important difference with the Calculus course is that it is not
           enough to say that the derivative of <m>x^n</m>is 
          <m>nx^{n-1}</m> because that's what the power rule says. We want to know <alert>why</alert> the 
          power rule is true. In other words, we want to have a  <term>proof</term> of all statements we make.
          </p>
          <p> So most of the difference between the Calculus course and the Real Analysis course is that we 
          will give very precise definitions, and provide proofs for the statements made. This brings us to 
          an important discussion. You will find a number of courses that are listed
          as prerequisites for this course, such as the Calculus sequence and the Discrete math course. 
          While it will of course be helpful to be already familiar with limits, derivatives and integrals 
          (that you studied in Calculus), in reality we will study all those notions again from scratch and more
          in depth, without assuming any prior knowledge. But we will need to formulate very precise definitions
          and provide proofs of the statements. To this end, the Discrete course is a more essential prerequisite.
          You have been introduced to proofs in that course. In this course we will see how to apply the 
          skills and techniques for writing proofs to gain a real understanding of the various notions contained
          in the Calculus course, and just as importantly, to understand why all the rules and the theorems are true.
          </p>

  <section><title> The various types of numbers </title>
  <p>We assume knowledge of the <term>natural numbers</term>:
  <me> {\mathbb N}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\},</me>
  the <term>integers</term>:
  <me>{\mathbb Z}=\{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots\},</me>
  the <term>rational numbers</term>:
  <me>{\mathbb Q}=\left\{\frac{p}{q}: p\in {\mathbb Z}, q\in {\mathbb N}\right\}.</me>
  </p>
  <p> The natural numbers (sometimes also called <term>positive integers</term>) can be added and multiplied. The 
  number 1 is rather special for two reasons: it's the smallest of all, and it has the nice property that 
  <m>x\cdot 1=x=1\cdot x</m> for all natural numbers <m>x</m>. 
  The natural numbers cannot always be subtracted, for example <m>3</m> and <m>5</m> are natural numbers, 
  but <m>3-5</m> is not.
  </p>
  <p>
  The integers can be added, multiplied and subtracted. Beside 1, they have another special element, <m>0</m>, 
  that has the property that <m>x+0=x=0+x</m> for all integers <m>x</m>. They cannot always be divided. For example, 
  <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> are integers, but <m>2/3</m> is not. </p>
  <p> The rational numbers can be added, multiplied, subtracted,
  and divided (with the only exception that we cannot divide by <m>0</m>).   So we can do all the usual operations
  of arithemtic and algebra with the rational numbers. We say that they form a <term>field</term>, a concept that we 
  will describe more precisely in the next chapter. 
</p>

<p>
  So we can do all four operations with the rational numbers. But there is still something missing, and it is not
  something abstract, but actually quite practical. Suppose we want to build a fence for a field 
  (as in a corn or strawberry field, not 
  the math concept of field of the previous paragraph!) so that it will be  a square of area <m>A</m> square feet. 
  Because the area of a square
  of side <m>x</m> is <m>A=x^2</m>, this means that we need to solve the equation <m>x^2=A</m>, and the answer 
  is <m>x=\sqrt{A}</m>. </p>
  <p> So being able to find the square root of a positive number is of practical use.
  But already the ancient Greeks, in the 5th century BC, discovered that, for example, there can be no rational 
  number whose square is <m>2</m>. In other words, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> cannot be a rational number (we will 
  soon see a proof of this fact). This means that we need to go beyond the rational numbers, and consider a larger 
  set of numbers, called the Real numbers. These are the numbers that give the name "Real Analysis" to this course.
</p>
</section>



<section> <title>Logic and set theory</title>
<p>Unfortunately mathematics in school is often taught as a collection of rules and skills that allow students to solve
problems, such as equations, graphing problems, simplification of algebraic expressions, or complex calculations.
Discussions on the meaning of the concepts involved and the reason why the rules and techniques work are often
neglected. This course will be based on <term>definitions</term>, that precisely introduce and describe a new concept,
<term>statements</term> (also called theorems, or lemmas, or propositions)  based on these definitions, and <term>proofs</term> 
of the statements. We will now discuss a little each of these notions. </p>

<p> As mentioned in the previous section,  we need to be precise when making definitions, and we should only use 
concepts that have already been previously defined. But we need to start somewhere. There are notions that must be 
treated as understood, without appealing to any other previously 
defined concepts. Basic examples of these notions are those of <term>set</term><fn> Actually, in a more advanced 
treatment, the primitive, undefined notion is called a <term>class</term> and a set is defined to be a class with 
some desirable properties. See  <url href=" https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/139330/what-is-the-difference-between-a-class-and-a-set"> 
this discussion </url> if you are interestd in the difference between classes and sets.
 But we will consider a set a primitive notion. </fn> and <term>membership</term>. A set is 
a collection of elements. An element is a member of a set (or it belongs to it, or is contained in it) if it is one
of the elements that make up the set. These notions are primitive, in the sense that they cannot be explained or
defined in terms of other notions. We need
to start from here. We will use curly braces <m>\{ \ldots \}</m> to represent what a set contains, as we have already
done in the notation for <m>\mathbb N</m>, <m>\mathbb Z</m> and <m>\mathbb Q</m> in the previous section.</p>
<p>
In this course, the natural number, integers and rational numbers will also be considered 
 as already defined <fn>Again, this is not the case in more advanced treatments, where the natural numbers are defined
purely in terms of sets 
(see  <url href="http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~padraic/ucsb_2014_15/ccs_proofs_f2014/ccs_proofs_f2014_lecture4.pdf">
this lecture</url> for example), then the integers and rational numbers as 
<url href="https://static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/268/350/rational_equivalence_relations.pdf">
derived concepts</url> </fn>. 
So <m>\mathbb N</m>, <m>\mathbb Z</m> and <m>\mathbb Q</m>  are basic examples of sets.
If <m>A</m> is a set, we will use the notation <m>x\in A</m> to mean that <m>x</m> is an 
element of <m>A</m>, or that <m>x</m> belongs to <m>A</m>, and <m>x\not \in A</m> to mean that <m>x</m> is not
an element of <m>A</m>. So for example <m>3\in {\mathbb N}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{2}\not \in {\mathbb Z}</m>. 
</p>
  <p>
But how do we make other sets? Here logic, and other primitive notions, come into play. A <term>statement</term> is 
any sentence that must be either true or false. So "5 is a natural number" is a true statement, "New York is the
capital of the United States" is a false statement. But "Who are you?" is not a statement because it makes
no sense to ask if it is true or false, and  "onions taste good" is not a statement because whether it is true 
or false depends on who we ask. We will often use symbols with special font, such as <m>\cal P</m> or
<m>\cal Q</m>, followed by a colon, to denote statements. So we could write <m>\cal P</m>: "5 is a natural number" or
<m>\cal Q</m>: "New York is the capital of the United States". If we write <m>{\cal P}(x)</m>, it means
that the statement <m>\cal P</m> depends on whatever <m>x</m> may be. So for example 
<m>{\cal P}(x)</m>: "<m>x</m> is a natural number less than 5" is a statement that is true if <m>x</m> is
1,2,3 or 4, but it is false otherwise. In this situation we call <m>x</m> a <term>variable</term>. Of course a 
variable need not represent a number. We could consider the statement <m>{\cal P}(x)</m>: "<m>x</m> is a student
in this class", and then <m>x</m> represents a person. 
    </p>
<p>A common and useful way to describe sets is the <term>set builder notation</term>. Suppose
<m>{\cal P}(x)</m> is a statement depending on some variable <m>x</m>. We can then consider the set 
of all possible <m>x</m> that will make <m>{\cal P}(x)</m> true, and we denote it by 
<m>\{x| {\cal P}(x)\}</m>. So if 
<me>{\cal P}(x): x \mbox{ is a natural number less than 5},</me> then
<me>\{x| {\cal P}(x)\}=\{1,2,3,4\}.</me>
The vertical bar <m>|</m> in the expression <m>\{x|{\cal P}(x)\}</m> is read <q>such that</q>. 
So we would read the expression as <q>The set of all <m>x</m> such that <m>{\cal P}(x)</m> is true.</q>
Sometimes we may also include some information about <m>x</m> before the vertical bar, and then we need less 
information in the statement <m>{\cal P}(x)</m>. So we could write the above example as
<me>\{x\in {\mathbb N}| x\lt 5\}.</me>
It is still the same set, <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>.
  </p>

<p>
  Once we feel comfortable with the notion of a set and what it means for something to belong to it, we can define
  the basic set operations such as <term>union</term> and <term>intersection</term>. This gives us the opportunity to illustrate
  our first definition.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-">
    <statement>
      <p>
 Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets. The  <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set consisting 
 of all elements that are either in <m>A</m> or in <m>B</m>, and it is denoted by <m>A\cup B</m>.   The 
 <term>intersection</term> of  <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set consisting 
 of all elements that are both in <m>A</m> and in <m>B</m>, and it is denoted by <m>A\cap B</m>.   
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>  
<p>Note that the word "or" in math is used in a different way than it is used in ordinary language. In math, 
<m>\cal P</m> or <m>\cal Q</m> means either <m>\cal P</m>, or <m>\cal Q</m>, or both. So if <m>x</m> is in <m>A\cup B</m>, then
<m>x</m> could be in <m>A</m>, or in <m>B</m>, or in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Compare with the ordinay use of "or" 
in the sentence "Would you like tea or coffee?". In this sentence it is evident that the choice is understood to
be between
one or the other, not both.</p>
<p>
  Let's pause a moment to examine what the above definition of union and intersection does. 
  First of all, it uses plain English. Then, it does two different things: it explains 
  what the new concepts are, <alert>and</alert> it assigns a name to them. The assigned
  names are <term>union</term> and <term>intersection</term>. Then, it also introduces some <alert>notation</alert> 
  in order to efficiently use the new concepts in writing. The notation introduced consists in the two symbols
  <m>\cup</m> and <m>\cap</m> that represent union and intersection, respectively. In summary, a definition
  often does three things: it explains the meaning of a new concept; it reserves a word or phrase 
  to be used for it; and (sometimes) it also reserves a symbol to be used for it.

</p>

<p>We stress the fact that plain English was used. This could have been done in a different way.
 We could have written the definition as follows:</p>
 <p>
 <alert> Definition</alert> The  <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set <m>A\cup B</m> defined by
 <me>A\cup B =\{x|x\in A \mbox{ or } x\in B\},</me>
 and the 
 <term>intersection</term> of  <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set <m>A\cap B</m> defined by
 <me>A\cap B =\{x|x\in A \mbox{ and } x\in B\}.</me>
</p>
<p> This second way to define union and intersection is perfectly good and correct. But, in this course we will
prefer to use plain English language whenever possible, in definitions, in statements of theorems, and in proofs.
This does not mean that we will not use symbols. On the contrary, symbols are very often essential to carry out 
complex proofs. But they should not be a substitute for words when the concept is more clearly explained or 
understood without them. Most people who have never heard of union and intersection will more easily understand
their definition in the one with the words rather than in the one with the symbols. It is often useful, as
an exercise, to express in words concepts presented using only symbols, and likewise
 to write in compact symbolic form statements that were made using only words.
</p>

<p> Before we proceed with more definitions, we need to review some logic. If <m>\cal P</m> is a statement, we
denote by <m>\sim \cal P</m> its negation. So <m>\sim \cal P</m> is true when <m>\cal P</m> is false, and
<m>\sim \cal P</m> is false when <m>\cal P</m> is true. For example, if <m>{\cal P} (x)</m>: "<m>x</m> is an integer 
greater than 1" then <m>\sim {\cal P} (x)</m>: "<m>x</m> is an integer less than or equal to 1".  
</p>

<p>
  If <m>\cal P</m> and <m>\cal Q</m> are statements, we can construct another statement, 
  called an <term>implication</term> denoted by <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> that is false
  <alert>only when</alert> <m>\cal P</m> is true and <m>\cal Q</m> is false. In all other cases it is true. 
  We read this  as "<m>\cal P</m> implies <m>\cal Q</m>", or "If <m>\cal P</m>, then <m>\cal Q</m>."
  The logic is that we
  are thinking that if <m>\cal P</m> is true, then  <m>\cal Q</m> must also be true, or
  that  <m>\cal Q</m> follows from <m>\cal P</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
  To understand why we say that the statement <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is always true except in the
  case that <m>\cal P</m> is true and <m>\cal Q</m> is false, think of it as a promise. So suppose 
  <m>\cal P</m> is the statement "the New Orleans Saints win the game" and <m>\cal Q</m> is the
  statement "Dustin will take Jasmine out to dinner". Then 
  <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is the promise that if the Saints win the game, 
 Dustin will take Jasmine out to dinner. How can this promise be broken? Only if the Saints win, and yet Dustin 
  does not take Jasmine out to dinner. In all other cases, the promise will not be broken. So if the Saints lose, the statement 
  <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> remains true for sure, whether or not Dustin takes Jasmine out to dinner, 
  because there is no broken promise.
  This logical property of implications is sometimes referred to by saying that "a false statement implies anything".
  </p>
  <p>
  <m>{\cal P} \Longleftrightarrow {\cal Q}</m> means that <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> and <m>{\cal Q}\Rightarrow {\cal P}</m>. 
  In this case we say that <m>\cal P</m> and <m>\cal Q</m> are <term>equivalent</term>.  Here is an example from 
  elementary Algebra. Suppose that <m>x</m> is a rational number. Then
  <me> 3x=4 \Longleftrightarrow x=\frac{4}{3}.</me> 
  In fact, all the steps involved in solving Algebra or Calculus problems are mostly sequences of equivalent 
  statements of this type.  
</p>
<p>
The negation of <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is often useful when writing proofs. It must be a statement
that is true precisely when <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is false, and we know that this happens 
only when <m>{\cal P}</m> is true and  <m>{\cal Q}</m> is false. So we see that
<me> \sim({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}) \Longleftrightarrow ({\cal P} \mbox{ and } \sim {\cal Q}).</me>
</p>
<p>
Another useful logical equivalence is :
<me>({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }) \Longleftrightarrow (\sim {\cal Q} \Rightarrow \sim {\cal P}).</me>
To understand this using the same example as before, saying "If the Saints win the game, Dustin takes Jasmine to dinner" 
is the same as saying "If Dustin doesn't take Jasmine to dinner, the Saints have lost the game".
</p>

<p>
We will now give a few more especially important definitions. A complete treatment of set theory can be found
in many freely avaialble online sources such as <url href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html">
this textbook on Discrete Mathematics</url>.
<definition xml:id="def-subset">
  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, we say that <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m> if every element
      of <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>, and in this case we write <m>A\subset B</m>. 
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>
Note again how this definition provides three pieces of information: the explanation of a new concept, 
its name in English (subset) and the symbol used <m>\subset</m>. We can make the same definition using only symbols:
<me>(A\subset B) \Longleftrightarrow (x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B).</me> 
So we can write 
<me>{\mathbb N}\subset {\mathbb Z} \subset {\mathbb Q}.</me>

  <section>
    <title>Basic facts about the integers </title>
    <p>
      The integers are the building blocks of mathematics and we will list here a few facts that
      will soon be needed. </p>
      
      <p>An integer <m>n</m> is <term>even</term> if it is twice another integer.  
      Another way to say this is that <m>m</m> is <term>divisible</term> by 2. So 
      <m>n</m> is even if <m>n=2m</m> where <m>m</m> is anther integer. For example, 
      10 is even because it is twice 5.
    </p>
    <p> An integer is <term>odd</term> if it is one more than twice another integer, which is the same 
      as saying that it is not divisible by 2. So <m>n</m>  is odd if <m>n=2m+1</m> for some other integer <m>m</m>. 
      For example, 9 is odd because it is one more than twice 4. We could also say an odd integer is 1 less than twice
      another integer, or <m>n=2m-1</m>. So 9 is 1 less than twice 5.  
    </p>
     <p> So the <term>positive even integers</term> (or <term>positive even natural numbers</term>) 
      are the elements of the set
      <me>\{2,4,6,\ldots\} = \{x\in {\mathbb N}| x=2m \mbox{ for some } m\in {\mathbb N}\}.</me>
     </p>
    </section>


<section><title> Writing proofs</title>
<p>
  The purpose of a proof in mathematics is to convince a reader (or a listener) that a certain statement is true. 
  So, besides being correct, it must be understandable and as easy as possible to follow. 
  Usually we are interested in proving that a statement of the form <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is true,
  where <m>\cal P</m> is statement containing all the <term>assumptions</term> and <m>\cal Q</m> is a statement 
  containing the <term>conclusions</term>. We will discuss four different types of proofs, with examples.

  </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Direct proofs</title>
    <p>
In this type of proof, if we want to prove that  <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is true, we  
derive logical consequences from the assumptions contained in <m>\cal P</m> until we reach the conclusion 
that <m>\cal Q</m> is true. 
      </p>
      <example>
<p>Prove that if <m>n</m> is an even integer, then <m>3n</m> is divisible by 6. 
</p>
<p>In this problem, the given assumptions consist in the 
  statement <me>{\cal P}: n \mbox{ is an even integer}</me>
  the conclusion is the statement <me>{\cal Q}: 3n \mbox{ is divisible by 6}</me> and we want to prove 
  <m>{\cal P}\Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m>. 
</p>
<p>
So we start deriving logical conclusions. <m>\cal P</m> is saying that <m>n</m> is even, 
so we can write <m>n=2m</m> for some integer
<m>m</m>. Then <m>3n=3(2m)=6m</m>. But this means that <m>3n</m> is divisible by 6. So we conclude that <m>\cal Q</m>
is true.
