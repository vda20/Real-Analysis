      <title>Introduction</title>

      <section xml:id="section-title">
        <title>How is this course different from Calculus?</title>
        <p>A large portion of this course will consist in studying real numbers, functions of a real variable, 
        continuity, limits, derivatives and integrals. So what is the difference with the Calculus course?
        An example will be useful to explain the difference. Suppose Jasmine has just taken the Calculus course,
        and  she is helping Kevin with this problem: If <m>f(x)=x^{10}</m>, find <m>f'(x)</m>. Jasmine solves
         the problem and gets the right answer: using the power rule,
          she finds that <m>f'(x)=10x^9</m>. This is what she learned in the 
        Calculus course.</p>
        <p>
        But suppose now Kevin asks: "But what does <m>f'(x)</m> stand for?". 
        Jasmine will probably answer: "It's the derivative of <m>f(x)</m>". This is correct, but it really doesn't 
        explain what it is, it just says what its name is. If Kevin is curious he will want to know what 
        the derivative is
        all about and why we are so interested in it. Depending on how well Jasmine learned the Calculus material,
        she may be able to explain that the derivative is the limit as <m>h</m> goes to zero of the 
        difference quotient <m>(f(x+h)-f(x))/h</m>, and it represents the slope of the tangent line to the 
        graph of <m>f</m>. But if Kevin were to press her with the next natural question:
         "but what is a limit? And what is a tangent line?", she would not be able to give a precise answer. 
         And almost surely, 
         she will not be able to explain why the derivative of <m>x^n</m> is <m>nx^{n-1}</m>. Because in the 
         Calculus course much of the focus is on how to <alert>use</alert> some rules, without worrying where they 
         come from. 
          </p>
          <p>In Real Analysis, we will give a very precise meaning to all notions we meet. So it is not enough to say
          that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x)</m> is a number that <m>f(x)</m> gets closer and closer to when <m>x</m> gets 
          closer and closer to <m>c</m>. Instead, we will give a precise <term>definition</term> that uses only notions to 
          which we can already give a precise meaning. In the example of the limit, the notion of "closer and closer" 
          commonly used in the Calculus course is not clear at all. We may have an intuitive idea, but what precisely
          do we mean by "closer and closer"?
          </p>
          <p>
          The other important difference with the Calculus course is that it is not
           enough to say that the derivative of <m>x^n</m>is 
          <m>nx^{n-1}</m> because that's what the power rule says. We want to know <alert>why</alert> the 
          power rule is true. In other words, we want to have a  <term>proof</term> of all statements we make.
          </p>
          <p> So most of the difference between the Calculus course and the Real Analysis course is that we 
          will give very precise definitions, and provide proofs for the statements made. This brings us to 
          an important discussion. You will find a number of courses that are listed
          as prerequisites for this course, such as the Calculus sequence and the Discrete math course. 
          While it will of course be helpful to be already familiar with limits, derivatives and integrals 
          (that you studied in Calculus), in reality we will study all those notions again from scratch and more
          in depth, without assuming any prior knowledge. But we will need to formulate very precise definitions
          and provide proofs of the statements. To this end, the Discrete course is a more essential prerequisite.
          You have been introduced to proofs in that course. In this course we will see how to apply the 
          skills and techniques for writing proofs to gain a real understanding of the various notions contained
          in the Calculus course, and just as importantly, to understand why all the rules and the theorems are true.

  <section><title> The various types of numbers </title>
    <subsection><title><m>\mathbb N, \mathbb Z</m> and <m>\mathbb Q</m></title>
  <p>We assume knowledge of the <term>natural numbers</term>:
  <me> {\mathbb N}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\},</me>
  the <term>integers</term>:
  <me>{\mathbb Z}=\{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots\},</me>
  and the <term>rational numbers</term> <m>\mathbb Q</m>, consisiting of all fractions that have an integer in the 
  numerator, and a natural number in the denominator, such as <m>2/3</m> or <m>-1/7</m>. 
  Note that in the definition of rational numbers, the denominator  could be 1,
  and since <m>p/1=p</m>, all the integers are automatically also rational numbers.  So every natural number is
  an integer, and every integer is a rational number.
  </p>
  <p> The natural numbers (sometimes also called <term>positive integers</term>) can be added and multiplied. The 
  number 1 is rather special because it has the property that 
  <m>x\cdot 1=x=1\cdot x</m> for all natural numbers <m>x</m>. 
  The natural numbers cannot always be subtracted, for example <m>3</m> and <m>5</m> are natural numbers, 
  but <m>3-5</m> is not.
  </p>
  <p>
  The integers can be added, multiplied and subtracted. Beside 1, they have another special element, <m>0</m>, 
  that has the property that <m>x+0=x=0+x</m> for all integers <m>x</m>. They cannot always be divided. For example, 
  <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> are integers, but <m>2/3</m> is not. </p>
  <p> The rational numbers can be added, multiplied, subtracted,
  and divided (with the only exception that we cannot divide by <m>0</m>).   So we can do all the usual operations
  of arithmetic and algebra with the rational numbers. We say that they form a <term>field</term>, a concept that we 
  will describe more precisely in the next chapter. In this course, the natural number, integers and rational numbers will be considered 
 as already defined. <fn>This is not the case in more advanced treatments, where the natural numbers are defined
purely in terms of sets 
(see  <url href="http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~padraic/ucsb_2014_15/ccs_proofs_f2014/ccs_proofs_f2014_lecture4.pdf">
this lecture</url> for example), then the integers and rational numbers as 
<url href="https://static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/268/350/rational_equivalence_relations.pdf">
derived concepts</url>. </fn> 
</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection><title>Order</title>
<p> 
Another important concept that applies to all three types of numbers is that of <term>order</term>. Given
any two numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> (whether they are natural, integers, or rational), unless the two numbers are
the same, one must be smaller than then other. In symbols, if <m>x\neq y</m>, then either <m>x\lt y</m> or <m>y\lt x</m>.
So we say that the rational numbers form an <term>ordered field</term>, and this will be the main object of study of the
next chapter.
</p> 


<p>
  We already said that we can do all four operations with the rational numbers. 
  But there is still something missing. Suppose we want to build a fence for a field 
  (as in a corn or strawberry field, not 
  the math concept of field mentioned earlier!) so that it will be  a square of area <m>A</m> square feet. 
  Because the area of a square
  of side <m>x</m> is <m>A=x^2</m>, this means that if we want to know how long the side of the 
  square is,  we need to solve the equation <m>x^2=A</m>, and the answer 
  is <m>x=\sqrt{A}</m>. </p>
  <p> So being able to find the square root of a positive number is of practical use.
  But already the ancient Greeks, in the 5th century BC, discovered that, for example, there can be no rational 
  number whose square is <m>2</m>. In other words, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> cannot be a rational number (we will 
  soon see a proof of this fact). This means that we need to go beyond the rational numbers, and consider a larger 
  set of numbers, called the Real numbers. These are the numbers that give the name <q>Real Analysis</q> 
  to this course.
</p>

</section>



<section> <title>Logic and set theory</title>
<p>Unfortunately mathematics in school is often taught as a collection of rules and skills that allow students to solve
problems, such as equations, graphing problems, simplification of algebraic expressions, or complex calculations.
Discussions of the meaning of the concepts involved and the reason why the rules and techniques work are often
neglected. This course will be based on <term>definitions</term>, that precisely introduce and describe a new concept,
<term>statements</term> (also called theorems, or lemmas, or propositions)  based on these definitions, and <term>proofs</term> 
of the statements. We will now discuss a little each of these notions. </p>
<subsection><title>Statements</title>
  <p>
    A <term>statement</term> is 
any sentence that must be either true or false. So <q>5 is a natural number</q> is a true statement and 
<q>New York is the
capital of the United States</q> is a false statement. But <q>Who are you?</q> is not a statement because it makes
no sense to ask if it is true or false, and  <q>onions taste good</q> is not a statement because whether it is true 
or false depends on who we ask. We will often use symbols with special font, such as <m>\cal P</m> or
<m>\cal Q</m>, followed by a colon, to denote statements. So we could write <q> <m>\cal P</m>: 5 is a natural number</q>
 or
<q><m>\cal Q</m>: New York is the capital of the United States</q>. If we write <m>{\cal P}(x)</m>, it means
that the statement <m>\cal P</m> depends on whatever <m>x</m> may be. So for example 
<q><m>{\cal P}(x)</m>: <m>x</m> is a natural number less than 5</q> is a statement that is true if <m>x</m> is
1,2,3 or 4, but it is false otherwise. In this situation we call <m>x</m> a <term>variable</term>. Of course a 
variable need not represent a number. We could consider the statement <q><m>{\cal P}(x)</m>: <m>x</m> is a student
in this class</q>, and then <m>x</m> represents a person. 
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Logic</title>
<p> We will now review some logic.  If <m>\cal P</m> is a statement, we
  denote by <m>\sim \cal P</m> its negation. So <m>\sim \cal P</m> is true when <m>\cal P</m> is false, and
  <m>\sim \cal P</m> is false when <m>\cal P</m> is true. For example, if 
  <console> <m>{\cal P} (x)</m>: <m>x</m> is an integer 
  greater than 1</console> then <q><m>\sim {\cal P} (x)</m>: <m>x</m> is an integer less than or equal to 1</q>.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If <m>\cal P</m> and <m>\cal Q</m> are statements, we can construct another statement, 
    called an <term>implication</term> denoted by <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> that is false
    <alert>only when</alert> <m>\cal P</m> is true and <m>\cal Q</m> is false. In all other cases it is true. 
    We read this  as "<m>\cal P</m> implies <m>\cal Q</m>", or "If <m>\cal P</m>, then <m>\cal Q</m>."
    The logic is that we
    are thinking that if <m>\cal P</m> is true, then  <m>\cal Q</m> must also be true, or
    that  <m>\cal Q</m> follows from <m>\cal P</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    To understand why we say that the statement <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is always true except in the
    case that <m>\cal P</m> is true and <m>\cal Q</m> is false, think of it as a promise. So suppose 
    <m>\cal P</m> is the statement <q>the New Orleans Saints win the game</q> and <m>\cal Q</m> is the
    statement <q>Dustin will take Jasmine out to dinner</q>. Then 
    <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is the promise that if the Saints win the game, 
   Dustin will take Jasmine out to dinner. How can this promise be broken? Only if the Saints win, and yet Dustin 
    does not take Jasmine out to dinner. In all other cases, the promise will not be broken. So if the Saints lose, the statement 
    <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> remains true for sure, whether or not Dustin takes Jasmine out to dinner, 
    because there is no broken promise.</p>

    <p>
    This logical property of implications is sometimes referred to by saying that 
    <q>a false statement implies anything</q>. To show that it can play a role in understanding
    what a definition really says, we consider an example from Linear Algebra.
    One of the conditions for a matrix to be in Row Echelon Form is the following:
    <q>If the matrix has any zero rows, they must all be at the bottom.</q>
    This is an implication <m>{\cal P}\Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m>,
     with <q><m>{\cal P}</m>: The matrix has some zero rows</q>
    and <q><m>{\cal Q}</m>: All zero rows are at the bottom</q>.
    It is easy to understand  that the matrix
    <me> \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ 0 \amp 4 \amp 5 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \end{pmatrix} </me>
satisfies this condition, and the matrix
<me> \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\ 0 \amp 4 \amp 5 \end{pmatrix} </me>
does not. But what about the matrix
<me> \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ 0 \amp 4 \amp 5 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 3 \end{pmatrix} ? </me>
It is not unusual for students to say that this matrix is not in Row Echelon Form, because there is
no zero row at the bottom . But in fact the implication <q><m>{\cal P}\Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m></q> is true,
because <m>{\cal P}</m> is false (there are no zero rows). So the condition is satisfied.
  </p>
    <p>
    <m>{\cal P} \Longleftrightarrow {\cal Q}</m> means that <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> and <m>{\cal Q}\Rightarrow {\cal P}</m>. 
    In this case we say that <m>\cal P</m> and <m>\cal Q</m> are <term>equivalent</term>.  Here is an example from 
    elementary Algebra. Suppose that <m>x</m> is a rational number. Then
    <me> 3x=4 \Longleftrightarrow x=\frac{4}{3}.</me> 
    In fact, all the steps involved in solving Algebra or Calculus problems are mostly sequences of equivalent 
    statements of this type.  
  </p>
  <p>
  The negation of <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is often useful when writing proofs. It must be a statement
  that is true precisely when <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is false, and we know that this happens 
  only when <m>{\cal P}</m> is true and  <m>{\cal Q}</m> is false. So we see that
  <me> \sim({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}) \Longleftrightarrow ({\cal P} \mbox{ and } \sim {\cal Q}).</me>
  </p>
  <p>
  Another useful logical equivalence is :
  <me>({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }) \Longleftrightarrow (\sim {\cal Q} \Rightarrow \sim {\cal P}).</me>
  The implication <m>\sim {\cal Q} \Rightarrow \sim {\cal P}</m> is called the <term>contrapositive</term>
  of the implication <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }</m>.
  To understand this using the same example as before, saying 
  <q>If the Saints win the game, then Dustin takes Jasmine to dinner</q> 
  is the same as saying <q>If Dustin doesn't take Jasmine to dinner, then the Saints have lost the game</q>. 
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Quantifiers</title>
  <p>
When a statement <m>{\cal P}(x)</m>  depends on some variable, there are two especially 
important situations that we need to consider:
<ul>
  <li> The statement is true for <alert>all</alert> <m>x</m></li>
  <li>The statement is true for <alert>some</alert> <m>x</m>. </li>
  </ul>
  The two symbols (called <term>quantifiers</term>) <m>\forall</m> (read as: <q>for all</q>) and 
  <m>\exists</m> (read as <q>there exists</q>)
  are useful to write such statements. So for example, suppose <m>x</m> represents people and 
  <q><m>{\cal P}(x): x</m> likes chocolate</q>. Then the satement <q> Everybody likes chocolate</q> can be 
    written as <m>(\forall x){\cal P}(x)</m>, while the statement
     <q> There are some people who don't like chocolate</q> is <m>(\exists x)\sim {\cal P}(x)</m>.

  </p>
<p>
  Note that the statement <q>There are some people who don't like chocolate</q> is the precise
  negation of the statement <q>Everybody likes chocolate</q>. This is reflected by the fact that <m>\forall </m> 
  turns to <m>\exists </m> and <m>{\cal P}</m> turns to <m>\sim {\cal P}</m>, and provides a useful rule of thumb
  to write the negation of complex logical statements: change all <m>\forall </m> to <m>\exists </m> and 
  all <m>\exists </m> to <m>\forall </m>, and change every statement to its negation. 
</p>
<example>
  <p> Suppose that we work with rational numbers, so all the variables  represent rational numbers. 
    Consider the statement <q>Every number has a square root.</q>
    We can write the statement
     in symbols as
    <me>(\forall x)(\exists y)(y^2=x).</me>
    According to our rule, the negation is
    <me>(\exists x)(\forall y)(y^2\neq x).</me>
    In fact, the last statement says "There is some rational number <m>x</m> with the property that 
    whatever rational number <m>y</m> we use, the square of <m>y</m> will not be <m>x</m>".
    This is the same thing as saying that there is some <m>x</m> that does not have a square root.  </p>

</example>

</subsection>


<subsection><title>Sets</title>
<p> We will review some of the basic notions of set theory.
  A more complete treatment of the theory can be found
in many freely avaialble online sources such as 
 <url href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html">
this textbook on Discrete Mathematics</url>.
 </p>
 <p> As we already mentioned,  we need to be precise when making definitions, and we should only use 
concepts that have already been previously defined. But we need to start somewhere. There are notions that must be 
treated as understood, without appealing to any other previously 
defined concepts. Basic examples of these notions are those of <term>set</term><fn> Actually, in a more advanced 
treatment, the primitive, undefined notion is called a <term>class</term> and a set is defined to be a class with 
some desirable properties. See  <url href=" https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/139330/what-is-the-difference-between-a-class-and-a-set"> 
this discussion </url> if you are interestd in the difference between classes and sets.
 But we will consider a set a primitive notion. </fn> and <term>membership</term>. A set is 
a collection of elements. An element is a member of a set (or it belongs to it, or is contained in it) if it is one
of the elements that make up the set. These notions are primitive, in the sense that they cannot be explained or
defined in terms of other notions. We need
to start from here. We will use curly braces <m>\{ \ldots \}</m> to represent what a set contains, as we have already
done in the notation for <m>\mathbb N</m>, <m>\mathbb Z</m> and <m>\mathbb Q</m> in the previous section.</p>
<p> 
So <m>\mathbb N</m>, <m>\mathbb Z</m> and <m>\mathbb Q</m>  are basic examples of sets.
If <m>A</m> is a set, we will use the notation <m>x\in A</m> to mean that <m>x</m> is an 
element of <m>A</m>, or that <m>x</m> belongs to <m>A</m>, and <m>x\not \in A</m> to mean that <m>x</m> is not
an element of <m>A</m>. So for example <m>3\in {\mathbb N}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{2}\not \in {\mathbb Z}</m>. 
</p>
<p>
But how do we make other sets? Here logic, and the primitive notion of membership, come into play.
A common and useful way to describe sets is the <term>set builder notation</term>. Suppose
<m>{\cal P}(x)</m> is a statement depending on some variable <m>x</m>. We can then consider the set 
of all possible <m>x</m> that will make <m>{\cal P}(x)</m> true, and we denote it by 
<m>\{x| {\cal P}(x)\}</m>. So if 
<me>{\cal P}(x): x \mbox{ is a natural number less than 5},</me> then
<me>\{x| {\cal P}(x)\}=\{1,2,3,4\}.</me>
The vertical bar <m>|</m> in the expression <m>\{x|{\cal P}(x)\}</m> is read <q>such that</q>. 
So we would read the expression as <q>The set of all <m>x</m> such that <m>{\cal P}(x)</m> is true.</q>
Sometimes we may also include some information about <m>x</m> before the vertical bar, and then we need less 
information in the statement <m>{\cal P}(x)</m>. So we could write the above example as
<me>\{x\in {\mathbb N}| x\lt 5\}.</me>
It is still the same set, <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>.
  </p>
</subsection>
<subsection><title>Set operations</title>
<p>
  Once we feel comfortable with the notion of a set and what it means for something to belong to it, we can define
  the basic set operations such as <term>union</term> and <term>intersection</term>. This gives us the opportunity to illustrate
  our first definition.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-">
    <statement>
      <p>
 Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets. The  <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set consisting 
 of all elements that are either in <m>A</m> or in <m>B</m>, and it is denoted by <m>A\cup B</m>.   The 
 <term>intersection</term> of  <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set consisting 
 of all elements that are both in <m>A</m> and in <m>B</m>, and it is denoted by <m>A\cap B</m>.   
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>  
<p>Note that the word <q>or</q> in math is used in a different way than it is used in ordinary language. In math, 
<m>\cal P</m> or <m>\cal Q</m> means either <m>\cal P</m>, or <m>\cal Q</m>, or both. So if <m>x</m> is in <m>A\cup B</m>, then
<m>x</m> could be in <m>A</m>, or in <m>B</m>, or in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. 
Compare with the ordinay use of "or" 
in the sentence <q>Would you like tea or coffee?</q>. In this sentence it is evident that the choice is understood to
be between
one or the other, not both.</p>
<p>
  Let's pause a moment to examine what the above definition of union and intersection does. 
  First of all, it uses plain English. Then, it does two different things: it explains 
  what the new concepts are, <alert>and</alert> it assigns a name to them. The assigned
  names are <term>union</term> and <term>intersection</term>. Then, it also introduces some <alert>notation</alert> 
  in order to efficiently use the new concepts in writing. The notation introduced consists of the two symbols
  <m>\cup</m> and <m>\cap</m> that represent union and intersection, respectively. In summary, a definition
  often does three things: it explains the meaning of a new concept; it reserves a word or phrase 
  to be used for it; and (sometimes) it also reserves a symbol to be used for it.

</p>

<p>We stress the fact that plain English was used. This could have been done in a different way.
 We could have written the definition as follows:</p>
 <p>
 <definition>  The  <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set <m>A\cup B</m> defined by
 <me>A\cup B =\{x|x\in A \mbox{ or } x\in B\},</me>
 and the 
 <term>intersection</term> of  <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the set <m>A\cap B</m> defined by
 <me>A\cap B =\{x|x\in A \mbox{ and } x\in B\}.</me>
 </definition>
</p>
<p> This second way to define union and intersection is perfectly good and correct. But, in this course we will
prefer to use plain English language whenever possible, in definitions, in statements of theorems, and in proofs.
This does not mean that we will not use symbols. On the contrary, symbols are very often essential to carry out 
complex proofs. But they should not be a substitute for words when the concept is more clearly explained or 
understood without them. Most people who have never heard of union and intersection will more easily understand
their definition in the one with the words rather than in the one with the symbols. It is often useful, as
an exercise, to express in words concepts presented using only symbols, and likewise
 to write in compact symbolic form statements that were made using only words.
</p>


<p>
We will now give a few more especially important definitions. 
<definition xml:id="def-subset">
  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, we say that <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m> if every element
      of <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>, and in this case we write <m>A\subset B</m>. 
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>
Note again how this definition provides three pieces of information: the explanation of a new concept, 
its name in English (subset) and the symbol used <m>\subset</m>. We can make the same definition using only symbols:
<me>(A\subset B) \Longleftrightarrow (x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B).</me> 
Using the <m>\subset</m> symbol, we can write the statement that  every natural number
 is an integer, and every integer is a rational number (made at the beginning of section 1.2) as:  
<me>{\mathbb N}\subset {\mathbb Z} \subset {\mathbb Q}.</me>
  </p>
</subsection>
<p>
<definition>
  If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, the <term>set difference</term> <m>A\setminus B</m> is defined to be the set of
  all elements in <m>A</m> that are not in <m>B</m>. In symbols,
  <me>A\setminus B = \{x\in A| x\not \in B\}.</me>
</definition>
</p>
<p> For example, <m>\mathbb Z \setminus \mathbb N</m> is the set of all negative integers, together with 0, and 
  <m>\mathbb Q \setminus \mathbb Z</m> is the set of rational numbers that, when written in lowest terms, have
   a denominator larger than 1.</p>

    <title>Basic facts about the integers </title>
    <p>
      The integers are the building blocks of mathematics and we will list here a few facts that
      will soon be needed. </p>
      <subsection><title>Even and Odd integers</title>
      <p>An integer <m>n</m> is <term>even</term> if it is twice another integer.  
      Another way to say this is that <m>m</m> is <term>divisible</term> by 2. So 
      <m>n</m> is even if <m>n=2m</m> where <m>m</m> is another integer. For example, 
      10 is even because it is twice 5.
    </p>
    <p> An integer is <term>odd</term> if it is one more than twice another integer, which is the same 
      as saying that it is not divisible by 2. So <m>n</m>  is odd if <m>n=2m+1</m> for some other integer <m>m</m>. 
      For example, 9 is odd because it is one more than twice 4. We could also say an odd integer is 1 less than twice
      another integer, or <m>n=2m-1</m>. So 9 is 1 less than twice 5. Every integer is either even or odd. So the 
      negation of <q><m>n</m> is even</q> is <q><m>n</m> is odd</q>.  
    </p>
     <p> So the <term>positive even integers</term> (or <term>positive even natural numbers</term>) 
      are the elements of the set
      <me>\{2,4,6,\ldots\} = \{x\in {\mathbb N}| x=2m \mbox{ for some } m\in {\mathbb N}\}</me>
      and the <term>positive odd integers</term> are the elements of the set
      <me>\{1,3,5,\ldots\} = \{x\in {\mathbb N}| x=2m+1 \mbox{ for some } m\in {\mathbb N}\}.</me>
     </p>
    </subsection>
<subsection><title>Divisibility</title>
     <p> If <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> are integers, and <m>m\neq 0</m>, we say that
       <m>n</m> is <term>divisible</term> by <m>m</m> if <m>n=km</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. In this
       case we say that <m>k</m> is the <term>quotient</term> of the division. We also say that <m>k</m> and 
       <m>m</m> are <term>factors</term>, or <term>divisors</term> of <m>n</m>.  
       Another way of saying that <m>n</m> is divisible by <m>m</m> is that <m>n/m</m> is an integer.
       Note that according to this definition, 0 is divisble by any <m>m\neq 0</m> (using <m>k=0</m> as the 
       quotient).
     </p>
<p>
  Given two integers <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>, the <term>greatest common divisor</term> (often abbrievated 
  by <m>\gcd(m,n)</m> ) of 
  <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> is the largest integer that is a divisor of both. So if <m>d=\gcd(m,n)</m>
  then <m>d</m> divides both <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>, and there is no integer larger than <m>d</m> that
  does the same.
</p>
<example>
  <p>
    <m>\gcd(6,15)=3</m>, <m>\gcd(3,18)=3</m>, <m>\gcd(4,9)=1</m>.
  </p>
</example>
<p>
A rational number can be written in many different ways, because we can always multiply or divide both 
numerator and denominator by the same number. So for example
<me>\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}=\frac{10}{15}.</me> 
But given any rational number <m>\frac{p}{q}</m>, we can divide both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> by their gcd and 
obtain a fraction in <term>lowest terms</term>, meaning that it cannot be written using lower values of
numerator or denominator. So <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> is the lowest terms form for 
<m>\frac{4}{6}</m> and <m>\frac{10}{15}</m>.<abbr></abbr> 
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection><title>The Well-Ordering Principle</title>
  <p>
  We now notice one property of the natural numbers that the integers and the rationals do not have: <m>\mathbb N</m> has a 
  <term>least element</term>, the number 1, because <m>1\lt n</m> for all <m>n\in {\mathbb N}, n\neq 1</m>. In fact
  this property is shared with any subset of <m>\mathbb N</m>. It is an <term>axiom</term>, that is, a statement that is
  taken to be true without proof. </p>
  <p>
  <axiom> <title>The Well-Ordering Principle</title><p> Suppose <m>S</m> is a non-empty subset of <m>\mathbb N</m>. 
    Then <m>S</m> has a least element.</p>
  </axiom>
  </p>
  <p>
    So for example the least element of the even numbers is <m>2</m>. The Well-Ordering Principle
    (that we abbreviate as WOP) surely makes
    sense, because our intutition tells us that of course, if we have a set of positive integers, one of them must be 
    the smallest.  
    But, as it often happens when we are dealing with sets that contain infinitely many elements, 
    this property cannot be proved from the other properties of the natural numbers. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We stress that the WOP is special of the positive integers. For <m>\mathbb Z</m>, WOP fails in an obvious 
    way: just consider <m>\mathbb Z</m> itself. What is its smallest element? Of course it does not exist, because 
    we can take negative integers as large as we want. In the case of the rational numbers <m>\mathbb Q</m>, there is
    another, more subtle reason why the WOP fails, 
    quite different from the fact that we can take larger and larger negative numbers. We can consider the set
     <me>S=\left\{\left. \frac{1}{n} \right| n\in {\mathbb N} \right\}.</me> 
    Then <m>S</m> is a non-empty subset of <m>\mathbb Q</m>, but it has no least element. 
    This should be intuitively clear, because we can make <m>n</m> larger and larger and get <m>1/n</m> as
    small as we want, and there will not be a smallest value. We will prove it in the next chapter.

<section><title> Writing proofs</title>
<p>
  The purpose of a proof in mathematics is to convince a reader (or a listener) that a certain statement is true. 
  So, besides being correct, it must be understandable and as easy as possible to follow. 
  Usually we are interested in proving that a statement of the form <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is true,
  where <m>\cal P</m> is a statement containing all the <term>assumptions</term> and <m>\cal Q</m> is a statement 
  containing the <term>conclusions</term>. We will discuss four different types of proofs, with examples.

  </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Direct proofs</title>
    <p>
In this type of proof, if we want to prove that  <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> is true, we  
derive logical consequences from the assumptions contained in <m>\cal P</m> until we reach the conclusion 
that <m>\cal Q</m> is true. 
      </p>
      <example>
<p>Prove that if <m>n</m> is an even integer, then <m>3n</m> is divisible by 6. 
</p>
<hint>
<p>In this problem, the given assumptions consist in the 
  statement <me>{\cal P}: n \mbox{ is an even integer}</me>
  the conclusion is the statement <me>{\cal Q}: 3n \mbox{ is divisible by 6}</me> and we want to prove 
  <m>{\cal P}\Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m>. Think about what it means for <m>n</m> to be even.
</p>
</hint>
<solution component="instructor">
<p>
We start deriving logical conclusions. <m>\cal P</m> is saying that <m>n</m> is even, 
so we can write <m>n=2m</m> for some integer
<m>m</m>. Then <m>3n=3(2m)=6m</m>. But this means that <m>3n</m> is divisible by 6. So we conclude that <m>\cal Q</m>
is true. 
</p>
</solution>
</example>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-Contrapositive">
  <title>Contrapositive</title>
  <p>
Instead of proving <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }</m>, it is sometimes easier to prove   its contrapositive
<m>\sim {\cal Q} \Rightarrow \sim{\cal P }</m>. The two statements are logically equivalent, so proving one 
we also prove the other.  
  </p>
  <example xml:id="n2even">
    <p>Suppose that <m>n</m> is a positive integer. Prove that if <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is
      even.  
    </p>
    <hint>
    <p>We start assuming <m>n</m> is a positive integer and we let  <me>{\cal P}: n^2 \mbox{ is even },</me>
      <me>{\cal Q}: n \mbox{ is even }.</me> 
      Now write the contrapositive of <m>{\cal P}\Rightarrow {\cal Q}</m> and use a direct proof.
    </p>
  </hint>
      <solution component="instructor">
        <p>We want to prove  <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }</m>. But if we start by assuming that <m>n^2</m> is even,
      that is, <m>n^2=2m</m> for some <m>m</m>, it is not clear what we should do next. It would be a lot easier
      if we could start with a statement about <m>n</m>, not <m>n^2</m>. Since 
      <m>\sim {\cal Q}: n \mbox{ is odd }</m>  and <m>\sim {\cal P}: n^2 \mbox{ is odd }</m>,
      the contrapositive says that if <m>n</m> is odd, then <m>n^2</m> is also odd. So we start by assuming 
      that <m>n</m> is odd. This means that <m>n=2m+1</m> for some integer <m>m</m>. But then 
      <m>n^2=(2m+1)^2=4m^2+4m+1=2(2m^2+2m)+1</m> and we can re-write <m>n^2=2k+1</m> where <m>k=2m^2+2m</m> 
      is an integer. 
      So we see that <m>n^2</m> is also odd, and we conclude that 
      <m>\sim {\cal Q} \Rightarrow \sim{\cal P }</m> is true, and so 
      <m>{\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }</m> is also true and we are done.
    </p>
  </solution>
      </example>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title> Contradiction</title>
      <p> Suppose we know that a statement <m>\cal Q</m> is false. If we can prove that 
        <m>\sim {\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }</m>, then <m>\sim {\cal P}</m> cannot be true (because it leads to 
        a false statement), and so <m>\cal P</m> must be true.  Usually we do not know what the false statement 
        <m>\cal Q</m> is at the beginning of a proof by contradiciton. The strategy is to start from the negation 
        of the statement we want to prove, then derive logical consequences until we reach a statement that we
        recognize as false. We then say that we have reached a contradiction, and the original statement must be true.
        </p>
    
        <example> 
          <p>
          We want to prove that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is not a rational number. 
          <hint> We want to prove the statement 
          <m>{\cal P}: \sqrt{2}\not \in {\mathbb Q}</m>. Proceed by contradiction, and write <m>\sqrt{2}</m> as
          a fraction in lowest terms. Then multiply by the denominator, and square the equation.</hint>
        </p>
          <solution component="instructor">
          <p> Assume that 
          <m>\sim {\cal P}: \sqrt{2}\in {\mathbb Q}</m> is true. This means that <m>\sqrt{2}=\frac{n}{m}</m> where
          <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> are integers. Now let <m>d=\gcd(m,n)</m>. Then we can write 
          <m>n=du, m=dv</m>, where <m>\gcd(u,v)=1</m>, and <m>\sqrt{2}=\frac{n}{m}=\frac{du}{dv}=\frac{u}{v}</m>,
          and <m>\frac{u}{v}</m> is a fraction in lowest terms. Squaring the equation <m>\sqrt{2}=\frac{u}{v}</m>,
           we find that 
          <m>2=\frac{u^2}{v^2}</m>,
          that is the same as <m>u^2=2v^2</m>. Since <m>v^2</m> is an integer, this is telling us that <m>u^2</m>
           is even. By <xref ref="n2even"/>, <m>u</m> must be even. So we can write <m>u=2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
           But then we find <m> (2k)^2=2v^2</m>, or <m>4k^2=2v^2</m>, and dividing this equation by 2, we get
           <m>2k^2=v^2</m>. But this means that <m>v</m> is also even, and we reach the conclusion that <m>u</m> and
           <m>v</m> are both even. We know this to be false, because the fraction <m>\frac{u}{v}</m>
            is in lowest terms. So we have reached a contradiction, and we conclude that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is not a 
            rational number.
          </p>
        </solution>
        </example>
    </subsection>
    <subsection><title> Induction</title>
      <p>A useful way to prove statements that involve positive integers is by <term>induction</term>,
        as is discussed in the Discrete course.  We will now review the concepts involved, and
         state our first theorem.</p>
      <p>
<theorem> <title>Principle of 
  Mathematical Induction</title>      
        <p>Suppose that for each positive integer <m>n</m>, <m>{\cal P}(n)</m> is a statement.
        Suppose that  <m>{\cal P}(1)</m> is true <alert>and</alert> 
        <m> {\cal P}(n)\Rightarrow {\cal P}(n+1)</m> for all <m>n\in {\mathbb N}</m>.  Then 
        <m>{\cal P}(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\in {\mathbb N}</m>.</p>
</theorem>
      </p>
      <p>
      It's important to note that in the Principle of Mathematical Induction (that we abbreviate as PMI)
      there are three statements involved:
        <ol marker="a">
          <li> <m>{\cal P}(1)</m> is true </li>
          <li> <m> {\cal P}(n)\Rightarrow {\cal P}(n+1)</m> for all <m>n\in {\mathbb N}</m></li>
          <li><m>{\cal P}(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\in {\mathbb N}</m>.</li>
        </ol>
        and the PMI says that if both a. and b. are true, then c. is true. So the PMI is the implication
        statement:
<dl><li> (a. and b.) <m>\Rightarrow </m> c.</li></dl> 
The implication <m>{\cal P}(n)\Rightarrow {\cal P}(n+1)</m> is often called the <term>induction step</term>
and it is usually here that the hard part of the proof is found. When proving the induction step, the statement
<m>{\cal P}(n)</m> is called the <term>induction hypothesis</term>. 
        </p>
        <p> The PMI is a theorem because it can be proved from the Well-Ordering Principle. In fact, we could also
          take a different point of view. We could say that the PMI is an axiom, and then the WOP
          can be proved from it. In other words, WOP and PMI are equivalent statements. They cannot both be proved, but
          if we assume one as an axiom, then the other follows as a theorem.  </p>
          <p>
            <example>
              <p>Prove that <m>n\lt 2^n</m> for all positive integers <m>n</m>. 
                <hint> Write down what the statement <m>{\cal P}(n)</m> is, check that <m>{\cal P}(1)</m> is
                  true, and then prove <m>{\cal P}(n+1)</m> assuming that <m>{\cal P}(n)</m> is true.
                </hint>
              </p>
                <solution component="instructor">
                  <p>Let
              <m>{\cal P}(n): n\lt 2^n</m>, and this is statement c. in our discussion of PMI above. Statement
              a. is <m>{\cal P}(1):  1\lt 2^1</m>, which is surely true. So if we prove the induction step 
              b.,  that is:
               <m>{\cal P}(n)\Rightarrow {\cal P}(n+1)</m>, 
              then we are done, because PMI tells us that a. and b. imply c. </p>
              <p> So we start by assuming the induction hypothesis, that is 
              <m>n\lt 2^n</m>. Then we note that, for any <m>n\gt 1</m>,  <m>n+1\lt n+n=2n</m>. Since we are
              assuming <m>n\lt2^n</m>, we find <m>n+1\lt 2n \lt 2(2^n) = 2^{n+1}</m>, 
              so that <m>{\cal P}(n+1)</m> is true. We have now shown that <m>{\cal P}(n+1)</m> follows 
              from <m>{\cal P}(n)</m>,
              or <m>{\cal P}(n)\Rightarrow {\cal P}(n+1)</m>, and that is statement b., and so by the PMI we conclude
              that c. is true.  </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
          </p>
          <p component="instructor">
            Note that the crucial step in the solution above was the statement that <m>n+1\lt n+n</m>
            for every positive integer <m>n\gt 1</m>. While this is obvious once we see it, it's not so easy to think
            of it as a necessary step in the proof. This is a fact with a lot of mathematical proofs. The crucial 
            idea behind a proof is often the result of some insight that can only come with a lot of 
            practice and experience.

  <title>Cases in proofs</title>

    It often happens that a statement is most easily understood and proved if we break it down into two or more cases,
    as the next example illustrates.

<example>
  <p>We want to prove that for every positive integer <m>n</m>, the fraction <m>\frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>, in spite

  <m>n</m> odd.</hint> </p>
  <solution component="instructor">
 <p> If <m>n</m> is even, then <m>n=2m</m> for some integer <m>m</m>, and so

  <m>m</m>, and then <me>\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=\frac{n(2m+1+1)}{2}=\frac{2n(m+1)}{2}=n(m+1),</me> an integer.

  <m>\frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m> is an integer, and we are done.</p>

    <chapter><title>The Real Numbers</title>
      <section>
      <title> Ordered Fields </title>
      <p>
      In the previous chapter we have discussed the rational numbers <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and said that they 
      form an ordered field. We now take a different, and abstract, point of view. We extract some of the  
      properties of the rational number, and list them as axioms. We will then say that any set that satisfies
      those properties is called an ordered field.</p>
      
      <p>All the other properties of the ordered field must be
      consequences of these axioms. It is important to distinguish between axioms, and properties that derive from
      them (that we can call theorems). So for example <m>x+0=x</m> is one of the  axioms, that cannot be proved. 
      But instead <m>x\cdot 0 =0</m> is a theorem (of which we will soon see the proof).
      </p>
      <p>
      Bear in mind that the elements of the 
      set <m>F</m> we are about to introduce 
      are not necessarily rational number. We think of them just as abstract elements of a set that satisfy 
      a list of axioms. Later in the chapter we will add one more crucial axiom, and we will call
      the resulting set satisfying all those properties the Real Numbers.
      </p>
      
        <p>We start with a set <m>F</m>. A <term>binary operation</term> on a set is any function with domain
        <m>F\times F</m> and range <m>F</m> (recall that <m>F\times F</m> is the set of all pairs <m>(x,y)</m> of
        elements of <m>F</m>). We now assume that our set <m>F</m> has two binary operations, called addition and 
        multiplication. Given an input <m>(x,y)</m>, the output of addition is denoted by <m>x+y</m> and the output
        of multiplication is denoted by <m>xy</m> (or sometimes <m>x\cdot y</m>). These operations satisfy the 
        following axioms:</p>
<p>
        <dl> 
          <li><title>A1 (Commutativity) </title> <m>x+y=y+x \hspace{5ex}</m> for all <m>x,y\in F</m> 
          </li>
          <li><title>A2 (Associativity)</title>
            <m>x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z \hspace{5ex}</m> for all <m>x,y,z \in F</m>
        </li>
        <li><title>A3 (Additive identity)</title>
          There is a unique element <m>0\in F</m>, called the <term>additive identity</term>, such that <m>x+0=x 
            \hspace{1ex} \mbox{ for all } x\in F
          </m> 
      </li>
      <li><title>A4 (Additive inverse)</title>
        For each <m>x\in F</m>, there is a unique element <m>-x\in F</m>, called the <term>additive inverse</term>, such that
         <m>x+(-x)=0</m>.
      </li>
        </dl>
        </p>
<p>
  Any set <m>F</m> with a binary operation <m>+</m> that satisfies axioms A1-A4 is called an <term>abelian group</term>. 
  So for example the integers <m>\mathbb Z</m> with the operation of addition are an abelian group. Of course a 
  common name for the additive identity af axiom A3 is <q>zero</q>. 
</p>
<p>
  The multiplication operation satisfies the following axioms:</p>

  <p>
    <dl width="wide"> 
      <li><title>M1 (Commutativity) </title> <m>xy=yx \hspace{1ex}</m> for all <m>x,y\in F</m> 
      </li>
      <li><title>M2 (Associativity)</title>
        <m>x(yz)=(xy)z \hspace{5ex}</m> for all <m>x,y,z \in F</m>
    </li>
    <li><title>M3 (Multiplicative identity)</title>
      There is a unique element <m>1\in F</m>, called the <term>multiplicative identity</term>, such that <m>1\neq 0</m>
      and  <m>1x=x 
        \hspace{1ex} \mbox{ for all } x\in F
      </m> 
  </li>
  <li><title>M4 (Multiplicative inverse)</title>
    For each non-zero element <m>x\in F</m>, there is a unique element <m>x^{-1}\in F</m>, 
    called the <term>multiplicative inverse</term>, such that
     <m>xx^{-1}=1</m>.
  </li>
    </dl>
</p>
<p>
Note that the symmetry between the two operations is not perfect, because we require <m>x\neq 0</m> for the 
existence of the multiplicative inverse, but there is no restriction on the existence of the additive inverse. 
Another way to say this is that <m>-1</m> is defined, but <m>0^{-1}</m> is not. We now add one more axiom that relates 
the two operation, and further breaks the symmetry.
</p>
<p>
<dl><li><title>D (Distributive law)</title>
  <m>x(y+z)=xy+xz \hspace{3ex} </m> for all <m>x,y,z\in F</m></li>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
Any set with two binary operations satisfying A1-A4, M1-M3, D is called a <term>commutative ring</term>.
So the integers with the operations <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> form a commutative ring. 
If axiom M4 is also satisfied, then <m>F</m> is called a <term>field</term>. So the rational numbers
with the operations <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are an example of a field. But there are other examples.
An important one is the set  <m>{\mathbb Q}[i]=\{a+ib| a,b \in {\mathbb Q}, i^2=-1\}</m>.  
</p>
<p> We can now state our first theorem.</p>
<theorem>
<p>In any field <m>F</m>, <m>x\cdot 0 = 0</m> for all <m>x\in F</m>.</p>
</theorem>
<proof>
  <p>
    <hint> Use the fact that <m>0+0=0</m> and the distributive law. </hint>
  </p>
  <solution component="instructor">
    <p>
      Using A3 with <m>x=0</m>, we find <m>0=0+0</m>.
      Then using the distributive law, we have
      <me> x\cdot 0=x\cdot (0+0)= x\cdot 0+x\cdot 0.</me>
      Now add <m>-(x\cdot 0)</m> to both sides to get
      <me> x\cdot 0 +-(x\cdot 0) = (x\cdot 0+x\cdot 0)+-(x\cdot 0).</me>
      Use the definition of additive inverse on the left and the associative law A2 on the right:
      <me> 0=x\cdot 0+(x\cdot 0+-(x\cdot 0))</me>
      Now use the definition of additive inverse again:
      <me> 0=x\cdot 0+0</me>
      and finally use A3 to find
      <me>0=x\cdot 0.</me>
    </p>
  </solution>
</proof>

<p>
We now introduce four order axioms. We assume that there is a <term>binary relation</term><fn> A binary relation 
  on a set <m>F</m> is just any subset <m>S</m> of <m>F\times F</m>. Writing <m>x\lt y</m> is just a convenient way
  to write that <m>(x,y)\in S</m>.
</fn> , denoted by <m>\lt </m>,
satisfying the axioms:
</p>

<p>
  <dl> 
    <li><title>O1 (Total order) </title> For all <m>x,y\in F</m>, either <m>x\lt y</m>, or <m>y\lt x</m>, or <m>x=y</m>. 
    </li>
    <li><title>O2 (Transitivity)</title> If 
      <m>x\lt y</m> and <m> y\lt z</m>, then <m>x\lt z</m>.
  </li>
  <li><title>O3</title> If <m>x\lt y</m>, then <m>x+z\lt y+z</m> for all <m>z\in F</m>.
</li>
<li><title>O4 </title>If <m>x\lt y</m> and <m>0\lt z</m>, then <m>xz\lt yz</m>.
</li>
  </dl>
</p>

<p>
So the rational numbers together with the usual ordering form an ordered field. But
there is no way to define an order satisfying the four order axioms on the field <m>{\cal Q}[i]</m>.
