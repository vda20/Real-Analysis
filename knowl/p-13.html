<div class="para">The PMI is a theorem because it can be proved from the Well-Ordering Principle. In fact, we could also take a different point of view. We could say that the PMI is an axiom, and then the WOP can be proved from it. In other words, WOP and PMI are equivalent statements. They cannot both be proved, but if we assume one as an axiom, then the other follows as a theorem.</div>
