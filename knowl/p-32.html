<div class="para">Letâ€™s pause a moment to examine what the above definition of union and intersection does. First of all, it uses plain English. Then, it does two different things: it explains what the new concepts are, <em class="alert">and</em> it assigns a name to them. The assigned names are <dfn class="terminology">union</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">intersection</dfn>. Then, it also introduces some <em class="alert">notation</em> in order to efficiently use the new concepts in writing. The notation introduced consists of the two symbols <span class="process-math">\(\cup\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cap\)</span> that represent union and intersection, respectively. In summary, a definition often does three things: it explains the meaning of a new concept; it reserves a word or phrase to be used for it; and (sometimes) it also reserves a symbol to be used for it.</div>
