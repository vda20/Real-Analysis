<div class="para">But suppose now Kevin asks: "But what does <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> stand for?". Jasmine will probably answer: "It’s the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span>". This is correct, but it really doesn’t explain what it is, it just says what its name is. If Kevin is curious he will want to know what the derivative is all about and why we are so interested in it. Depending on how well Jasmine learned the Calculus material, she may be able to explain that the derivative is the limit as <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> goes to zero of the difference quotient <span class="process-math">\((f(x+h)-f(x))/h\text{,}\)</span> and it represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> But if Kevin were to press her with the next natural question: "but what is a limit? And what is a tangent line?", she would not be able to give a precise answer. And almost surely, she will not be able to explain why the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(x^n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(nx^{n-1}\text{.}\)</span> Because in the Calculus course much of the focus is on how to <em class="alert">use</em> some rules, without worrying where they come from.</div>
