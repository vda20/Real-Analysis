<div class="para">So most of the difference between the Calculus course and the Real Analysis course is that we will give very precise definitions, and provide proofs for the statements made. This brings us to an important discussion. You will find a number of courses that are listed as prerequisites for this course, such as the Calculus sequence and the Discrete math course. While it will of course be helpful to be already familiar with limits, derivatives and integrals (that you studied in Calculus), in reality we will study all those notions again from scratch and more in depth, without assuming any prior knowledge. But we will need to formulate very precise definitions and provide proofs of the statements. To this end, the Discrete course is a more essential prerequisite. You have been introduced to proofs in that course. In this course we will see how to apply the skills and techniques for writing proofs to gain a real understanding of the various notions contained in the Calculus course, and just as importantly, to understand why all the rules and the theorems are true.</div>
