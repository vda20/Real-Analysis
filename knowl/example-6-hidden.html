We have now shown that <span class="process-math">\({\cal P}(n+1)\)</span> follows from <span class="process-math">\({\cal P}(n)\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\({\cal P}(n)\Rightarrow {\cal P}(n+1)\text{,}\)</span> and that is statement b., and so by the PMI we conclude that c. is true.</div></article></body>
