<div class="para">We stress once more that a field is defined by the nine axioms A1-A4, M1-M4, D. This means that we must be able to prove any statement we make about a field using <em class="alert">only</em> these nine axioms. This may be hard to do at first, because we routinely use rules from algebra and arithmetic, as they are taught in school, that are not found on the list of the nine axioms. In fact, any such rules can be broken down into steps that use only the nine axioms. An example will illustrate this.</div>
