<div class="para">We stress that the WOP is special of the positive integers. For <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb Z\text{,}\)</span> WOP fails in an obvious way: just consider <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb Z\)</span> itself. What is its smallest element? Of course it does not exist, because we can take negative integers as large as we want. In the case of the rational numbers <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb Q\text{,}\)</span> there is another, more subtle reason why the WOP fails, quite different from the fact that we can take larger and larger negative numbers. We can consider the set</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
S=\left\{\left. \frac{1}{n} \right| n\in {\mathbb N} \right\}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Then <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a non-empty subset of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb Q\text{,}\)</span> but it has no least element. This should be intuitively clear, because we can make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> larger and larger and get <span class="process-math">\(1/n\)</span> as small as we want, and there will not be a smallest value. We will prove it in the next chapter.</div>
