<div class="para">But how do we make other sets? Here logic, and other primitive notions, come into play. A <dfn class="terminology">statement</dfn> is any sentence that must be either true or false. So "5 is a natural number" is a true statement, "New York is the capital of the United States" is a false statement. But "Who are you?" is not a statement because it makes no sense to ask if it is true or false, and  "onions taste good" is not a statement because whether it is true or false depends on who we ask. We will often use symbols with special font, such as <span class="process-math">\(\cal P\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\cal Q\text{,}\)</span> followed by a colon, to denote statements. So we could write <span class="process-math">\(\cal P\text{:}\)</span> "5 is a natural number" or <span class="process-math">\(\cal Q\text{:}\)</span> "New York is the capital of the United States". If we write <span class="process-math">\({\cal P}(x)\text{,}\)</span> it means that the statement <span class="process-math">\(\cal P\)</span> depends on whatever <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> may be. So for example <span class="process-math">\({\cal P}(x)\text{:}\)</span> "<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a natural number less than 5" is a statement that is true if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is 1,2,3 or 4, but it is false otherwise. In this situation we call <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> a <dfn class="terminology">variable</dfn>. Of course a variable need not represent a number. We could consider the statement <span class="process-math">\({\cal P}(x)\text{:}\)</span> "<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a student in this class", and then <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> represents a person.</div>
