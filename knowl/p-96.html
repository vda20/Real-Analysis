<div class="para">The previous example shows that if we insist on using <em class="alert">only</em> the axioms to prove our statements, then even solving an equation as simple as <span class="process-math">\(ax+b=0\)</span> becomes a fairly complex task. What about all the algebra skills and rules learned in many years of school? Have they now become useless? To the contrary, we will need to often use them. When solving exercises, unless the directions explicitly say “use only the field axioms”, you should continue to use all the algebra rules you have used so far.</div>
