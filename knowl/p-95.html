<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">But none of these steps is found in any of the nine axioms! In fact, we never even mentioned subtraction and division in the axioms. At this point, we don’t know what those operations are. And what exactly do we mean by “simplification”? In spite of this, the steps we took really follow directly from the axioms, and our solution is, of course, correct. We will now solve the equation again using <em class="alert">only</em> the field axioms, but following the steps of our “normal” solution as a guide. We will refer to such a proof as an <dfn class="terminology">axiomatic proof</dfn>. We start with the given equation:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
ax+b=0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The first step was “subtract <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>”. We don’t know what that means, but we have Axiom A4 that says that <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> has an additive inverse, denoted by <span class="process-math">\(-b\text{.}\)</span> We can then add it to both sides of the equation, because we do have the addition operation. But we need to be careful. The left side of the equation is <span class="process-math">\(ax+b\text{,}\)</span> so we need to add the <span class="process-math">\(-b\)</span> to this, not just to <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> This means we need to use parentheses:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(ax+b)+(-b) = 0+(-b).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The next step should be clear: we want the <span class="process-math">\(-b\)</span> to be added to the <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> so we use Axiom A2 to re-arrange the parentheses, and on the right side we use the property of the additive identity (aka 0), Axiom A3:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
ax+(b+(-b))=-b.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now we use Axiom A4 (the property of the additive inverse):</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
ax+0=-b
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and then Axiom A3 again:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
ax=-b.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The next step should be “divide by <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>”, but again, we don’t know what that means. But we do have Axiom M4, that says that <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> since it is not zero, has a multiplicative inverse, that is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\text{.}\)</span> So we multiply both sides of the equation by <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\text{,}\)</span> again carefully using parentheses:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
a^{-1}(ax) =a^{-1}(-b).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now we can use Axiom M2:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(a^{-1}a)x = a^{-1}(-b)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">then the definition of multiplicative inverse, Axiom M4:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
1x=a^{-1}(-b)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and finally the definition of multiplicative identity, Axiom M3:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x=a^{-1}(-b).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This is the solution of our equation. We <em class="emphasis">almost</em> found the same solution as before.  As we will soon see, we can now consider <span class="process-math">\(\frac{-b}{a}\)</span> just as another way to write <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}(-b)\text{.}\)</span> But the solution we found the “normal” way was <span class="process-math">\(-\frac{b}{a}\text{.}\)</span> Is this the same as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{-b}{a}\text{?}\)</span> Of course it is, but this fact is not found in the axioms. So it must be proved <em class="alert">from</em> the axioms, and we will soon do it.</div>
