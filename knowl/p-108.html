<div class="para">We will often write <span class="process-math">\(x\gt y\)</span> to mean <span class="process-math">\(y\lt x\text{,}\)</span> and we call the elements <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x\gt 0\)</span> <dfn class="terminology">positive</dfn>. Axiom O3 is described by saying that <span class="process-math">\(\lt \)</span> preserves addition, and  Axiom O4 by saying that it preserves multiplication by positive elements. The next two theorems derive basic properties of the ordering relation that we routinely use, but that, once again, must be shown to derive directly only from the axioms. More properties are derived in the exercises at the end of the section.</div>
