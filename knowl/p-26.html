<div class="para">To understand why we say that the statement <span class="process-math">\({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}\)</span> is always true except in the case that <span class="process-math">\(\cal P\)</span> is true and <span class="process-math">\(\cal Q\)</span> is false, think of it as a promise. So suppose <span class="process-math">\(\cal P\)</span> is the statement "the New Orleans Saints win the game" and <span class="process-math">\(\cal Q\)</span> is the statement "Dustin will take Jasmine out to dinner". Then <span class="process-math">\({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}\)</span> is the promise that if the Saints win the game, Dustin will take Jasmine out to dinner. How can this promise be broken? Only if the Saints win, and yet Dustin does not take Jasmine out to dinner. In all other cases, the promise will not be broken. So if the Saints lose, the statement <span class="process-math">\({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q}\)</span> remains true for sure, whether or not Dustin takes Jasmine out to dinner, because there is no broken promise. This logical property of implications is sometimes referred to by saying that "a false statement implies anything".</div>
