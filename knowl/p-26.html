<div class="para">As we already mentioned,  we need to be precise when making definitions, and we should only use concepts that have already been previously defined. But we need to start somewhere. There are notions that must be treated as understood, without appealing to any other previously defined concepts. Basic examples of these notions are those of <dfn class="terminology">set</dfn><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-6-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.3.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> and <dfn class="terminology">membership</dfn>. A set is a collection of elements. An element is a member of a set (or it belongs to it, or is contained in it) if it is one of the elements that make up the set. These notions are primitive, in the sense that they cannot be explained or defined in terms of other notions. We need to start from here. We will use curly braces <span class="process-math">\(\{ \ldots \}\)</span> to represent what a set contains, as we have already done in the notation for <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb N\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb Z\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb Q\)</span> in the previous section.</div>
