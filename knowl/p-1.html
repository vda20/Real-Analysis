<div class="para">A large portion of this course will consist in studying real numbers, functions of a real variable, continuity, limits, derivatives and integrals. So what is the difference with the Calculus course? Maybe an example will be useful to explain the difference. Suppose Jasmine has just taken the Calculus course, and  she is helping Kevin with this problem: If <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^{10}\text{,}\)</span> find <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{.}\)</span> Jasmine solves the problem and gets the right answer: using the power rule, she finds that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)=10x^9\text{.}\)</span> This is what she learned in the Calculus course.</div>
