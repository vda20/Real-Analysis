<div class="para">So we can do all four operations with the rational numbers. But there is still something missing, and it is not something abstract, but actually quite practical. Suppose we want to build a fence for a field (as in a corn or strawberry field, not the math concept of field of the previous paragraph!) so that it will be  a square of area <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> square feet. Because the area of a square of side <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(A=x^2\text{,}\)</span> this means that we need to solve the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^2=A\text{,}\)</span> and the answer is <span class="process-math">\(x=\sqrt{A}\text{.}\)</span>
