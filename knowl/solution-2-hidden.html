<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">Assume that <span class="process-math">\(\sim {\cal P}: \sqrt{2}\in {\mathbb Q}\)</span> is true. This means that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}=\frac{n}{m}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> are integers. Now let <span class="process-math">\(d=\gcd(m,n)\text{.}\)</span> Then we can write <span class="process-math">\(n=du, m=dv\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\gcd(u,v)=1\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}=\frac{n}{m}=\frac{du}{dv}=\frac{u}{v}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{u}{v}\)</span> is a fraction in lowest terms. Squaring the equation <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}=\frac{u}{v}\text{,}\)</span> we find that <span class="process-math">\(2=\frac{u^2}{v^2}\text{,}\)</span> that is the same as <span class="process-math">\(u^2=2v^2\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(v^2\)</span> is an integer, this is telling us that <span class="process-math">\(u^2\)</span> is even. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/n2even.html" title="Example 1.1.1">ExampleÂ 1.1.1</a>, <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> must be even. So we can write <span class="process-math">\(u=2k\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> But then we find <span class="process-math">\((2k)^2=2v^2\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(4k^2=2v^2\text{,}\)</span> and dividing this equation by 2, we get <span class="process-math">\(2k^2=v^2\text{.}\)</span> But this means that <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is also even, and we reach the conclusion that <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> are both even. We know this to be false, because the fraction <span class="process-math">\(\frac{u}{v}\)</span> is in lowest terms. So we have reached a contradiction, and we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is not a rational number.</div></div></body>
