<div class="para">This second way to define union and intersection is perfectly good and correct. But, in this course we will prefer to use plain English language whenever possible, in definitions, in statements of theorems, and in proofs. This does not mean that we will not use symbols. On the contrary, symbols are very often essential to carry out complex proofs. But they should not be a substitute for words when the concept is more clearly explained or understood without them. Most people who have never heard of union and intersection will more easily understand their definition in the one with the words rather than in the one with the symbols. It is often useful, as an exercise, to express in words concepts presented using only symbols, and likewise to write in compact symbolic form statements that were made using only words.</div>
