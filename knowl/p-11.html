<div class="para">So being able to find the square root of a positive number is of practical use. But already the ancient Greeks, in the 5th century BC, discovered that, for example, there can be no rational number whose square is <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> In other words, <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> cannot be a rational number (we will soon see a proof of this fact). This means that we need to go beyond the rational numbers, and consider a larger set of numbers, called the Real numbers. These are the numbers that give the name "Real Analysis" to this course.</div>
