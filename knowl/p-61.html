<div class="para">We want to prove  <span class="process-math">\({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }\text{.}\)</span> But if we start by assuming that <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is even, that is, <span class="process-math">\(n^2=2m\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> it is not clear what we should do next. It would be a lot easier if we could start with a statement about <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> not <span class="process-math">\(n^2\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\sim {\cal Q}: n \mbox{ is odd }\)</span>  and <span class="process-math">\(\sim {\cal P}: n^2 \mbox{ is odd }\text{,}\)</span> the contrapositive says that if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd, then <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is also odd. So we start by assuming that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd. This means that <span class="process-math">\(n=2m+1\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span> But then <span class="process-math">\(n^2=(2m+1)^2=4m^2+4m+1=2(2m^2+2m)+1\)</span> and we can re-write <span class="process-math">\(n^2=2k+1\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k=2m^2+2m\)</span> is an integer. So we see that <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is also odd, and we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\sim {\cal Q} \Rightarrow \sim{\cal P }\)</span> is true, and so <span class="process-math">\({\cal P} \Rightarrow {\cal Q }\)</span> is also true and we are done.</div>
