<div class="para">Unfortunately mathematics in school is often taught as a collection of rules and skills that allow students to solve problems, such as equations, graphing problems, simplification of algebraic expressions, or complex calculations. Discussions on the meaning of the concepts involved and the reason why the rules and techniques work are often neglected. This course will be based on <em class="emphasis">definitions</em>, that precisely introduce and describe a new concept, <em class="emphasis">statements</em> (also called theorems, or lemmas, or propositions)  based on these definitions, and <em class="emphasis">proofs</em> of the statements. We will now discuss a little each of these notions.</div>
